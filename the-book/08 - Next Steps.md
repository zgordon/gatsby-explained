# Next Steps

In this book we have covered the core essentials of building Gatsby sites.  You should know how to setup Gatsby projects, make changes to templates and components and even load content from Markdown files.  

We also looked in depth at image optimization, which is an important factor for high performing sites.

You should also have a start on how to extend Gatsby sites with plugins and packages.

From here you should try building a Gatsby project on your own.  Maybe launch your personal portfolio site or a side project with Gatsby.  You might even feel comfortable enough taking on paying work building a simple Gatsby site.

Once you get comfortable with these essentials, here a few great next steps:

1. Look into how to pull data from a Content Management System (CMS) rather than markdown file
2. Explore the range of plugins and packages that are available for Gatsby and try testing some of them
3. Try setting up Apollo and making API calls to data outside of Gatsby to add dynamic functionality to your static Gatsby sites

Gatsby is a powerful tool and although we have covered the basics in this book, you will no doubt learn about things Gatsby can do we have not covered in this book.

Building static sites with Gatsby brings great benefits in terms of speed, scalability and developer experience.  It is my hope this book gave you a good start on your journey working with Gatsby and other related technologies.  I wish you the best!
